Daily Reflection (2026-01-08)
=============================================

SUMMARY:
The client proposal was completed as planned, but only one PR was reviewed instead of all, and the 30-minute walk was skipped due to an unexpected production issue and low afternoon energy.

COMPLETED GOALS:
- Finish client proposal

MISSED GOALS:
- Review PRs
- Go for a 30-minute walk

INSIGHTS:
- Unexpected issues can significantly impact planned tasks.
- Low energy in the afternoon affected productivity and ability to complete physical activity.
- Prioritizing critical tasks helped complete the most important goal.

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Build buffer time into the schedule to accommodate unexpected issues.
- Consider scheduling physically demanding activities during higher energy periods.
- Focus on prioritizing tasks when time is limited.

SUGGESTIONS FOR TOMORROW:
- Allocate specific time blocks for PR reviews with buffer for interruptions.
- Schedule the walk earlier in the day when energy levels are higher.
- Prepare contingency plans for unexpected issues to minimize disruption.
